Safely depositing cryptocurrency into your HashKey Exchange account requires attention to detail and adherence to platform protocols. Below is a streamlined guide to ensure a seamless experience.

### Key Deposit Requirements

1.  **Regulatory Compliance**
    
    Hash Blockchain Limited operates under Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (Types 1/7 licenses) and holds a virtual asset trading license under the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO).
    
2.  **Same-Name Policy**
    
    Deposits must originate from a wallet registered under the exact name as your HashKey Exchange account. Funds from mismatched accounts will be returned with fees (minimum transfer thresholds apply).
    
3.  **Whitelist Verification**
    
    Personal wallets require dual authentication: signature verification and small-amount testing. Frequent address changes prevent whitelisting—test with minimal funds first.
    
4.  **Supported Assets**
    
    Retail users can deposit/withdraw **BTC, ETH, AVAX, and LINK** only.
    
5.  **Stable Deposit Address**
    
    Your HashKey Exchange deposit address remains valid long-term. Changes (if any) will be notified in advance.
    
6.  **Minimum Deposit Limits**
    
    Each asset has a minimum deposit threshold; amounts below this will not be credited and cannot be recovered.
    
7.  **Deposit Discretion**
    
    HashKey Exchange reserves the right to accept/reject deposits and is not liable for third-party wallet/exchange issues.
    

### Step-by-Step Deposit Process

1.  **Retrieve Deposit Address**
    
    Log in → **"Assets" → "Custody Account" → "Deposit"**. Select your asset and blockchain network (e.g., ERC20 for ETH), then copy the unique address.
    
2.  **Initiate Transfer**
    
    Send funds from your wallet/exchange to the copied address, ensuring:
    

*   Network alignment (e.g., Bitcoin mainnet for BTC).
    
*   Correct memo field (if required for specific assets).
    

4.  **Confirm Receipt**
    
    Once blockchain confirmations are complete, funds will appear in your HashKey Exchange balance. Monitor network congestion for large transactions.
    

### Risk Mitigation Tips

*   **Double-Check Details**: Verify addresses and network types to avoid irreversible errors.
    
*   **Save Transaction IDs**: Keep TXIDs for tracking purposes.
    
*   **Stay Informed**: Monitor HashKey Exchange updates for service changes or maintenance.
