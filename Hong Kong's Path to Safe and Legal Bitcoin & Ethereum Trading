In Hong Kong’s evolving digital asset landscape, trading Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has become accessible yet requires adherence to a structured regulatory framework. As the city positions itself as a global crypto hub, understanding compliance, security protocols, and trading strategies is essential for both novice and experienced investors.

## Regulatory Framework for Crypto Trading

Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) governs crypto trading through its licensing system for Virtual Asset Trading Platforms (VATPs). Since 2023, exchanges offering Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets must obtain SFC approval, ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), KYC, and asset protection rules. This framework prioritizes investor safety while fostering innovation.
