In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading, the ability to convert digital assets into tangible fiat currency and transfer it to a bank account is of utmost importance. HashKey Exchange, renowned for its unwavering commitment to security and compliance, offers users a seamless and trustworthy method for withdrawing fiat currency directly to their bank accounts. This comprehensive guide will navigate you through every aspect of the fiat withdrawal process on HashKey Exchange, from the initial setup of withdrawal options to the finalization of the transaction.

## HashKey Exchange Bank Account Eligibility Criteria

To ensure a smooth and secure withdrawal experience, HashKey Exchange has specific guidelines regarding acceptable bank accounts:

*   **Prohibited Accounts**:
    

*   Accounts affiliated with banks on sanction lists that are widely prohibited by Hong Kong - based banks.
    
*   Bank accounts located in Mainland China.
    
*   Accounts where the name does not match the registered name of the user on the HashKey Exchange platform.
    
*   Accounts that are not fully (100%) owned by the client.
    
*   Accounts with limitations on incoming and outgoing transfers.
    
*   Non - general - use accounts, such as those with restricted functionality.
    
*   Bank credit card accounts, as they are not suitable for fiat withdrawals.
    

## Fiat Withdrawal Protocols

### Whitelisted Account Requirement

Fiat withdrawals are strictly limited to whitelisted bank accounts. These whitelisted accounts must be identical to the ones used by clients during their initial online deposit of HK$10,000 or an equivalent amount. This measure is in place to enhance security and prevent unauthorized transactions.

### Supported Currencies

Currently, HashKey Exchange facilitates withdrawals in two major currencies: Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) and United States Dollar (USD). This allows users to easily convert their cryptocurrency holdings into widely - recognized and usable fiat currencies.

### Processing Timeframes

Withdrawal requests can be submitted at any time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, the actual time it takes for the funds to reach the recipient's bank account is influenced by the processing times of both HashKey Exchange's bank and the receiving bank:

*   **HKD Withdrawals to Hong Kong Banks**:
    

*   For amounts less than HK$1 million, withdrawals may be processed within 24 hours.
    
*   For amounts equal to or exceeding HK$1 million, withdrawals are typically processed during Hong Kong bank business hours, which are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM (HK Time), Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays.
    

*   **USD Withdrawals to Hong Kong Banks**: Irrespective of the amount, USD withdrawals usually take 1 to 3 hours for processing during Hong Kong bank business hours.
    
*   **USD Withdrawals to Overseas Banks (Outside Hong Kong)**: These withdrawals generally require 1 to 2 business days to process.
    

## Client - Side Precautions

Before initiating a withdrawal, clients are strongly advised to verify the following aspects with their banks:

*   **Account Type**: Ensure that the bank account is a general - purpose account, suitable for all types of transactions.
    
*   **Transfer Permissions**: Confirm that the account allows unrestricted inbound and outbound transfers. Some accounts, especially certain types of savings accounts like fixed - deposit accounts in Hong Kong, may permit outbound transfers but restrict incoming ones. It is crucial to check for such limitations to avoid failed withdrawal attempts.
    
*   **Account Restrictions**: Ascertain that there are no special limitations or restrictions imposed on the account that could impede the withdrawal process.
    

  

In case a client's account has restrictions on incoming transfers, the user will need to add and whitelist a new bank account that supports incoming transfers to successfully complete the withdrawal. By choosing a platform like HashKey Exchange, which is regulated and highly secure, users can rest assured that their funds are safeguarded [throughout the entire transaction process, from deposit to withdrawal.](https://exchange.hashkey.com/en-US/blog/How-to-withdraw-Fiat-Currency-From-HashKey-Exchange)
