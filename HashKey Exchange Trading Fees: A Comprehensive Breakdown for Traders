When navigating HashKey Exchange, understanding how trading fees are structured is crucial for maximizing profitability. These fees are categorized into **maker fees** and **taker fees**, determined by whether your order adds liquidity (maker) or removes it (taker). Here’s a detailed look at how they apply across different trading pairs.

### 1\. Crypto-to-Crypto Trading

Fees here are denominated in the **base currency** of the trading pair:

*   **Example: BTC/USDT**
    

*   **Buy (Taker Order):** Fee charged in BTC
    
*   **Sell (Maker Order):** Fee charged in USDT
    

### 2\. Security Token (ST) to Crypto Trading

Fees are deducted in the **quote currency**:

*   **Example: SPICE/USDC**
    

*   **Buy or Sell:** Fee charged in USDC
    

### 3\. Fiat-to-Crypto Trading

Fees are calculated in the fiat currency specified:

*   **Example: BTC/USD or BTC/HKD**
    

*   **Buy or Sell:** Fee charged in USD or HKD
    

### Key Notes on Network Fees

*   **Trading Fees ≠ Network Fees:** Network fees are blockchain transaction costs (e.g., ETH gas fees) unrelated to HashKey’s charges.
    
*   **Withdrawals/Deposits:** Network fees apply when transferring crypto to/from the exchange, not during trades.
    

### Why This Matters

By grasping fee structures, traders can:

*   Optimize order types (maker vs. taker) to reduce costs.
    
*   Factor fees into profit calculations.
    
*   Choose trading pairs aligned with their strategy.
