The journey begins by visiting the official HashKey Exchange website. Once there, you'll spot the prominent "Register" button. Click on it, and you'll be prompted to input either your mobile phone number or email address. This is your gateway to the platform. Make sure to set up a strong, secure password to safeguard your account. After entering all the required details, double-check and confirm them.

**Step 2: Complete Identity Verification (KYC)**

For both regulatory compliance and your security, HashKey Exchange mandates that all users complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This is an essential step in ensuring a safe and legitimate trading environment. To complete your KYC, follow the instructions provided in this dedicated article. The process is straightforward and designed to protect your interests and the integrity of the platform.

  

**Step 3: Deposit Funds**

Once your account has been fully verified, it's time to add some funds. Log in to your account and navigate to the “Deposit” section. Here, you have a choice. Do you want to deposit fiat currency, such as Hong Kong Dollars (HKD), or another cryptocurrency?

If you opt for fiat deposits, you'll need to link your bank account. The platform will guide you through this process. Follow the instructions carefully and transfer the desired amount to fund your HashKey Exchange account.

On the other hand, if you're using cryptocurrency, the platform will provide you with a unique wallet address. Use this address to deposit the cryptocurrency funds you intend to use for trading.

  

**Step 4: Navigate to the Trading Section**

With your account funded, it's time to move on to the trading action. Head over to the Trading section, which may also be labeled as “Spot”. Here, you'll find a variety of BTC trading pairs available. For example, you can choose the BTC/HKD pair.

Once you've selected your trading pair, you'll be presented with two main options: Market Order and Limit Order. A Market Order allows you to buy Bitcoin at the current market price immediately. It's a quick and convenient option if you want to enter the market without delay. A Limit Order, on the other hand, enables you to set your own price at which you want to buy Bitcoin. This gives you more control over the price at which you enter the trade.

  

**Step 5: Execute Your Purchase**

Now comes the moment of truth. Enter the amount of HKD you wish to spend on buying Bitcoin. Take a moment to review your order carefully. Check all the details, including the amount, the trading pair, and the type of order (Market or Limit). Make sure everything is correct.

Once you're satisfied that all the details are in order, confirm the transaction. After the transaction is completed, your Bitcoin will be credited to your wallet shortly. Congratulations! You've successfully made your Bitcoin purchase on HashKey Exchange in Hong Kong.
